## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (DO THESE IN ORDER)

### STEP 1: Test Everything Locally (10 minutes)

**1A. Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r c:\Users\Nexus\Desktop\BITS_ML\requirements.txt
```

**1B. Test Jupyter Notebook:**
```bash
jupyter notebook c:\Users\Nexus\Desktop\BITS_ML\adult_classification_models.ipynb
```
- Run all cells (top to bottom)
- Should complete in 5-10 minutes
- You'll see metrics table with 6 models

**1C. Test Streamlit App:**
```bash
streamlit run c:\Users\Nexus\Desktop\BITS_ML\app.py
```
- Opens at http://localhost:8501
- Click through all 4 pages
- Try training models online

✅ If everything works, proceed to Step 2

---

### STEP 2: Create GitHub Repository (5 minutes)

**2A. Go to https://github.com (create account if needed)**

**2B. Create new repository:**
- Name: `ML-Assignment-2` (or any name)
- Description: "Adult Income Classification using 6 ML Models"
- Public (so it can be deployed)
- Add README (uncheck - we have our own)

**2C. Push your code:**
```bash
cd c:\Users\Nexus\Desktop\BITS_ML

git init
git add .
git commit -m "ML Assignment 2: Adult Income Classification"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ML-Assignment-2.git
git push -u origin main
```

✅ Your code is now on GitHub

**Save your GitHub URL:** `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ML-Assignment-2`

---

### STEP 3: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (10 minutes)

**3A. Go to https://streamlit.io/cloud**

**3B. Login with your GitHub account**

**3C. Click "New App"**

**3D. Select your repository:**
- Repository: `YOUR_USERNAME/ML-Assignment-2`
- Branch: `main`
- Main file path: `app.py`

**3E. Click "Deploy"**
- Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment
- It will give you a URL like: `https://ml-assignment-2-xxxx.streamlit.app`

✅ Your app is now live!

**Save your Streamlit URL:** `https://ml-assignment-2-xxxx.streamlit.app`

---

### STEP 4: Execute on BITS Virtual Lab (30 minutes)

**4A. Open BITS Virtual Lab**

**4B. Open terminal and clone:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ML-Assignment-2.git
cd ML-Assignment-2
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4C. Run Jupyter Notebook:**
```bash
jupyter notebook adult_classification_models.ipynb
```

**4D. Execute all cells:**
- Click Cell → Run All
- Wait for completion (~10 minutes)
- You'll see final metrics table

**4E. Take a Screenshot:**
- Screenshot should show:
  - The final metrics table (all 6 models, 6 metrics each)
  - All cells executed successfully
  - Clear and readable

**4F. Save Screenshot:**
- Save as: `BITS_Lab_Screenshot.png`
- Download to your computer

✅ You have proof of execution on BITS Lab

---

### STEP 5: Create Final PDF Submission (15 minutes)

**5A. Open Microsoft Word (or Google Docs/LibreOffice)**

**5B. Create a document with:**

**Page 1 - Title:**
```
ML ASSIGNMENT 2

Live Streamlit Application:
https://ml-assignment-2-xxxx.streamlit.app
```

**Page 3 - Screenshot:**
- Insert the BITS Lab screenshot here
- Add caption: "Execution on BITS Virtual Lab"

**Page 4 Onwards - README Content:**
- Copy full README.md content (or print to PDF)
- Include all sections:
  - Problem Statement
  - Dataset Description
  - Models Implemented
  - Evaluation Metrics
  - Performance Metrics Table
