Got it 👍 You want a **clear step-by-step list** of what is required for this assignment.
Here it is, **simplified and in order**, based directly on the assignment document .

---

## **Step-by-Step Requirements for ML Assignment-2**

### **STEP 1: Choose Dataset**

* Select **ONE classification dataset** from **Kaggle or UCI**
* Can be **binary or multi-class**
* Minimum:

  * **500 instances (rows)**
  * **12 features (columns)**

---

### **STEP 2: Implement ML Models**

Use the **same dataset** for all models.

Implement **all 6 classification models**:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. Naive Bayes (Gaussian or Multinomial)
5. Random Forest (Ensemble)
6. XGBoost (Ensemble)

---

### **STEP 3: Evaluate Each Model**

For **every model**, calculate these **6 metrics**:

* Accuracy
* AUC Score
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
* Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)

📸 **Take ONE screenshot** showing execution on **BITS Virtual Lab** (mandatory).

---

### **STEP 4: Create GitHub Repository**

Your repo **must contain**:

```
project-folder/
│-- app.py (or streamlit_app.py)
│-- requirements.txt
│-- README.md
│-- model/
│   └── saved model files (*.py or *.ipynb)
```

---

### **STEP 5: Create requirements.txt**

Include all dependencies, for example:

* streamlit
* scikit-learn
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
  (+ any others you used)

⚠️ Missing dependencies = deployment failure.

---

### **STEP 6: Write README.md (Very Important)**

README must include:

#### a) Problem Statement

#### b) Dataset Description

#### c) Models Used + Metrics Table

Create a **comparison table** like this:

| Model | Accuracy | AUC | Precision | Recall | F1 | MCC |
| ----- | -------- | --- | --------- | ------ | -- | --- |

#### d) Model Observations

Write **performance observations** for **each model**.

📄 **This README content must ALSO be copied into the final PDF.**

---

### **STEP 7: Build Streamlit App**

Your Streamlit app **must have**:

* CSV dataset upload (test data only)
* Model selection dropdown
* Display evaluation metrics
* Confusion matrix OR classification report

---

### **STEP 8: Deploy on Streamlit Cloud**

1. Go to **streamlit.io/cloud**
2. Login with GitHub
3. Click **New App**
4. Select your repository
5. Choose branch (main)
6. Select `app.py`
7. Click **Deploy**

🔗 Save the **live app link**

---

### **STEP 9: Prepare Final PDF Submission**

Your **single PDF file** must include (in order):

1. GitHub repository link
2. Live Streamlit app link
3. Screenshot of BITS Virtual Lab execution
4. Full README.md content

⚠️ **Only ONE submission allowed. No resubmission.**

---

### **STEP 10: Final Checklist Before Submitting**

✔ GitHub link works
✔ Streamlit app opens without errors
✔ All 6 models implemented
✔ All metrics calculated
✔ README added to PDF
✔ Screenshot included

---

If you want, I can:

* Make a **timeline plan (day-wise)**
* Suggest a **safe dataset**
* Give you a **Streamlit app template**
* Help write **README + observations**

Just tell me 👍
Short answer: **You MUST do it on BITS Virtual Lab (mandatory)** — but you **can also use your local laptop as support**.

Here’s the clear breakdown 👇

---

## ✅ **MANDATORY: BITS Virtual Lab**

* The assignment **has to be performed on BITS Virtual Lab**
* You must upload **ONE screenshot** as proof of execution on BITS Lab
* This screenshot carries **1 mark**
* If you face access issues, you must email the course coordinator (as mentioned in the assignment)

👉 **So for evaluation purposes, BITS Lab is compulsory**

---

## ⚠️ **Local Laptop (Optional but Allowed)**

You **may**:

* Develop code locally for convenience
* Test models and Streamlit app on your laptop
* Prepare README and requirements.txt locally

BUT:

* Final execution **must be run on BITS Virtual Lab**
* Screenshot must clearly show:

  * Code running
  * Models executing / metrics output

---

## ✅ **Best (Safe) Strategy – Recommended**

1. **Develop on your local laptop**

   * Faster, easier debugging
2. Push code to **GitHub**
3. Open **BITS Virtual Lab**
4. Pull the same GitHub repo
5. Run the code there
6. Take **ONE screenshot**
7. Deploy Streamlit app from GitHub

This avoids last-minute lab issues 👍

---

## ❌ What NOT to Do

* ❌ Doing everything only on local laptop
* ❌ Forgetting the BITS Lab screenshot
* ❌ Submitting without proof of BITS Lab execution

---

### 🔑 Final Verdict

**BITS Virtual Lab → compulsory for marks**
**Local laptop → allowed, but not sufficient alone**

If you want, I can:

* Guide you **how to open & run in BITS Virtual Lab**
* Tell you **what exactly should appear in the screenshot**
* Give a **safe workflow checklist**

Just say the word 😊
